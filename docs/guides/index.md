# Guides

To help you get started with `hml`, we provide a series of guides.

This series shows how to use the `hml` package to do a simple jet tagging task of the Z boson and QCD to dijets processes.

These guides together form a complete workflow of `hml`: generate events, create datasets, apply different approaches and evaluate the performance of them. It's recommended to read them in order.
