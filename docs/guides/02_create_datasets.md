# Create datasets

This guide demonstrates how to use observable parsing system to create a dataset for future use. With this system, you can create and use observables not only with specific classes but also with simple strings.

Start by importing the necessary modules:

```python
import uproot
from hml.generators import Madgraph5
from hml.representations import Image
from hml.datasets import SetDataset, ImageDataset
from hml.approaches import Cut
```

## Load generated events

As the previous guide showed, HML can handle two cases. Here, we use the `Madgraph5` class to fetch runs from the output directory:

```python
wjj = Madgraph5.from_output("data/pp2wz@10k", "mg5_aMC")
qcd = Madgraph5.from_output("data/pp2jj@10k", "mg5_aMC")

wjj_events = uproot.open(wjj.runs[0].events()[0])
qcd_events = uproot.open(qcd.runs[0].events()[0])
```

## Preselection

For the processes, we choose three observables: mass and n-subjettiness ratio of the leading fat jet, and the angular distance between the leading and subleading jets. To ensure we can obtain the observables without missing value, itâ€™s necessary to preselect or filter events based on the number of fat jets and jets:

```python
preselection = Cut("fatjet.size > 0 and jet.size > 1")
preselection.read(wjj_events)
preselection.value
```

<div class="result" markdown>

```
[True,
 True,
 True,
 True,
 True,
 False,
 True,
 True,
 False,
 True,
 ...,
 False,
 True,
 True,
 True,
 False,
 True,
 True,
 False,
 False]
------------------
type: 10000 * bool
```

</div>

- `fatjet.size` is the observable `Size` associated with the physics object `fatjet`. This observable refers to the number of the objects. In a root file, it applies to an entire branch. The physics object corresponds to the branch name (case-insensitive).
- An observable is always linked to one or more physics objects. This concept inspires HML to create its own observable parsing system: `<physics_object>,<another>.<observable>`. The `physics_object` is any branch defined in your root file. Multiple objects are separated by `,`. For a single object, specify the index directly after the object name, e.g., "jet0", "muon1".

To extract the observable values, use the `read` method, which returns a boolean list. The `value` attribute stores the result.

## Create a set dataset

Now, we use the 1D data container `SetDataset` to hold these three observables for all events:

```python
cut = "fatjet.size > 0 and jet.size > 1"

set_ds = SetDataset(["fatjet0.mass", "fatjet0.tau21", "jet0,jet1.delta_r"])
set_ds.read(wjj_events, 1, [cut])
set_ds.read(qcd_events, 0, [cut])
```

To confirm our choice of observables is powerful enough to differentiate the signal and background, we use `show` to plot three distributions:

```python
ds.show()
```

<div class="result" markdown>

![observable_distributions](../images/observable_distributions.png)

</div>

Right before saving the dataset to the disk, we use the `split` method to divide the dataset into training and testing sets:

```python
set_ds.split(0.7, 0.3, seed=42)
print(set_ds.train.samples.shape)
print(set_ds.train.targets.shape)

set_ds.save("data/wjj_vs_qcd_set.ds")
```

<div class="result" markdown>

```
(12644, 3)
(12644,)
```

</div>

The `split` method also supports the validation set: `set_ds.split(0.7, 0.2, 0.1)`.

## Create an image dataset

Besides a set dataset, we can also represent each event as an image and then create a dataset of these images.

```python
image_ds = ImageDataset(
    Image(
        height="fatjet0.constituents.phi",
        width="fatjet0.constituents.eta",
        channel="fatjet0.constituents.pt",
    )
    .with_subjets("fatjet0.constituents", "kt", 0.3, 0)
    .translate(origin="SubJet0")
    .rotate(axis="SubJet1", orientation=-90)
    .pixelate(size=(33, 33), range=[(-1.6, 1.6), (-1.6, 1.6)])
)
```

- The `Image` class is a representation of the image. It takes three arguments: `height`, `width`, and `channel`. The `height` and `width` are the observables for the y-axis and x-axis, respectively. The `channel` is the observable for the pixel intensity.
- The `with_subjets` method adds subjets to the image.
- The `translate` method moves the origin of the image to the subjet.
- The `rotate` method rotates the image.
- The `pixelate` method pixelates the image. This step makes the points discrete and produce the real image.

To create the image dataset, we still use the `read` method:

```python
image_ds.read(sig_events, 1, [cut])
image_ds.read(bkg_events, 0, [cut])
```

To visualize the images, there is also a `show` method:

```python
image_ds.show(norm="log", target=0, show_pixels=True)
image_ds.show(norm="log", target=1, show_pixels=True)
```

<div class="result" markdown>

![background image](../images/bkg_image.png)
![signal image](../images/sig_image.png)

</div>

Finally, we split and save the dataset:

```python
image_ds.split(0.7, 0.3, seed=42)
image_ds.save("data/wjj_vs_qcd_image.ds")
```
