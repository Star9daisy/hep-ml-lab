    "\n",
    "Currently there're three categories of built-in methods: cuts, trees, and (neural) networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a cut-based analysis, we apply a series of cuts on the input data to select as many signal events\n",
    "and as few background events as possible. Each cut reduces the number of background events and\n",
    "inevitably also signal events. The goal usually is to find a set of cuts that maximizes the significance\n",
    "$s/\\sqrt{s+b}$, where $s$ and $b$ are the number of remaining signal and background events, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The boosted decision tree is one of trees methods. It is a machine learning method commonly used in\n",
    "high energy physics. The name \"boosted\" comes from the idea to combine weak classifiers into a strong\n",
    "one. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are also neural networks methods. They will be covered in the next version.\n",
    "\n",
    "First import necessary packages."
