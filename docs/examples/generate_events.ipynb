    "# Generate events\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide shows how to generate events using Madgraph5 class in HML.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Madgraph5?\n",
    "[Madgraph5](https://launchpad.net/mg5amcnlo) is a framework providing all the necessary elements for\n",
    "studies of collider phenomenology. It is able to generate events from a given model in UFO format,\n",
    "connect to a parton shower tool like Pythia8, and perform detector simulation via tools like Delphes.\n",
    "It is a powerful and popular tool in the high energy physics community.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, you work with Madgraph5 via its command line interface (CLI). The main commands are\n",
    "`generate`, `output`, `launch`. `generate` is used to specify the processes you want to study.\n",
    "`output` is used to decide where to store the output files. `launch` starts generating the events.\n",
    "After this, you get two prompts: the first one lets you choose extra tools for parton shower and\n",
    "detector simulation, and the second one lets you tweak the parameters of the current theory model\n",
    "and generation run. Once you are done with both prompts, the event generation begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "After some trial and error with different settings, you can make a run script in plain text to\n",
    "tell Madgraph5 exactly what to do, step by step. It is a good practice to keep this script because\n",
    "it makes your work reproducible and consistent. It's also beneficial for others to understand what\n",
    "you have done and repeat your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Madgraph5 in HML\n",
    "While entering commands in the CLI is handy, it can be cumbersome to jump back and forth between\n",
    "the command line and the file browser. HML makes it easier to access the output data and other\n",
    "useful information.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start using it, let's first import the `Madgraph5` class from `hml.generators` module."
