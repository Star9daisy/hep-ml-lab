## Introduction

HML (HEP ML Lab) is a compact end-to-end framework for machine learning application in high energy physics. 

It provides a set of tools for data generation, model training and evaluation:

- `hml.generators`: API of Madgraph5 for simulating colliding events;
- `hml.theories`: Particle physics models;
- `hml.observables`: General observables in jet physics;
- `hml.representations`: Different data structure used to represent an event;
- `hml.datasets`: Existing datasets and helper classes for creating new datasets;
- `hml.methods`: Cuts, trees and networks for classification;
- `hml.metrics`: Metrics used in classical signal vs background analysis;
