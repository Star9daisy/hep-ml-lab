New observable naming convention

The observable name contains two parts:
1. Physics object name;
2. Observable class name.

The physics object name consists of two parts:
1. Branch name;
2. Index.

And it could be categorized into three types according to different combinations
of the branch name and index:
1. Single: the index is an integer, e.g. "Jet0", "Muon1", "Photon2";
2. Collective: the index is not specified, e.g. "Jet", "Muon", "Photon"; Or the
    index represents a range, e.g. "Jet1:", "Muon:2", "Photon1:3";
3. Multiple: this is the combination of the above two types and separated by
    comma, e.g. "Jet0,Muon1,Photon2", "Jet,Muon:2,Photon1:3".

For different types of physics objects, one still needs to make sure whether the
observable class supports it.
